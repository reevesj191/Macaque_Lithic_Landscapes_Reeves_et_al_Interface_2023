# Reeves et al. 2023 Macaque Technological Landscapes
This repository contains the code and markdown document (with supporting files) to carry out the statistical analyses published in the Journal of Royal Society Interface (hyperlink fourth coming). The Rmarkdown document (Reeves_et_al_RSI_Statstical_analysis) provides the code to the analysis that underlies the publication. If you find problems with the code, I am happy to fix any issues as they arise. Please either contact me or you can issue a pull request.

# Using this code

Ensure that you have all of the packages listed in each of the markdown documents to run the .rmd file.

# Feedback, bugs, and fixes.

Please cite Reeves et al 2023 if the code is used in publications.
